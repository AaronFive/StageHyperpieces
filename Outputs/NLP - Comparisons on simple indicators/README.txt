TITLE COMPARISONS

Comparisons of title proximity ran on the whole Dracor corpus, using BERT.
For each title, we give the closest title of a different play in the corpus, the corresponding ID, and a similarity score (between 0 and 1).
Associated file is compare_titles.py

The results are on the following spreadsheet : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CPdXUHMZR-EBqi33g2-VXWzkPN_EbhlTAI82ETOUKKs/edit?gid=491888048#gid=491888048
